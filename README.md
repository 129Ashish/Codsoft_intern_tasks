# Generic Codebase Project üöÄ
## Tagline: "A collection of code snippets for various programming problems"

üìñ Description.

The Generic Codebase project is a collection of code snippets for various programming problems. These code snippets are designed to be standalone and can be used as a starting point for solving different programming challenges. The project includes code for Java programming language and covers a range of topics from basic programming concepts to more advanced topics.

The codebase is organized into folders, each containing a specific problem or challenge. The code snippets are written in a clean and readable format, making it easy to understand and modify. The project is designed to be a useful resource for programmers of all levels, from beginners to experts.

‚ú® Features
